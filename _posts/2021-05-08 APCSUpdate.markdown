description: AP Computer Science Final Update

## Update:

Now that I have taken my AP Exam, and that I have officially finished my AP Computer Science A class I wanted to reflect on what I have learned this year. Online learning is difficult in a way to understand all the aspects of Computer Science, and personal time is VERY needed outside of the class in order to better understand the materials in the class. Computer Science is a passion that I am willing to follow into my future, as it is my college major of choice, and I believe that this class has shown me the very surface level of all the different  aspects of Computer Science that I will learn within the next 4 years of university and following into the future. 

As a result of this class completing, it is my last academic for high school and I will officially graduate high school May 28th, 2021. In August, I will officially begin my career as a Computer Science student at Kennesaw State University. Very excited for the future. More blog posts will come as I progress in my career to cover more topics in Computer Science and what I am learning. 

Thanks for reading! - Trey Morris (18)
