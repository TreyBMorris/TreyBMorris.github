description: AP Computer Science Update and Exam Update
---

## Update:

Just wanted to do a quick blog post reflecting of this semester and looking ahead to the end of my senior year of high school and my AP Computer Science exam. As of the posting of this update, the AP Computer Science Exam is exactly two weeks away. Nerves are already starting to come on, but knowing that the exam will help prepare me for my future and test my knowledge over what I have learned this semester excites me. I am still working on some personal projects to better prepare me for this exam and I am currently finishing the last unit over Recursion in my AP class. Online learning is difficult in a way to thoroughly understand all the aspects of Computer Science, and personal time is needed outside of the class in order to better understand the materials in the class. I have enjoyed this class so far and I'm excited for the exam.
