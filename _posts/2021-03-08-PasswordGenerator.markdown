## Intro:

As part of my first lab project in AP Computer Science A, I was tasked with writing a project that I had free will over creating. In this project, I had to used all knowledge I had learned prior in the course. In this project I used things such as...

- Primitive Data Types
- Using Objects
- Boolean Expressions and If Statements
- Iteration (For and While Loops)
- Writing Classes and Methods


#### Future Plans for this project
Although the project has been completed and submitted for a grade, I wish to further update this project and make it more effecient and build the code differently around things that I will later learn in the course. Later things I hope to include, if possible, will be arrays, inheritance, and recursion. I will later update this page and give updates on a future version of the project.
