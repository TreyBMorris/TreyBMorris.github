## What is this project about?
This project was my first data source project. This project was a final project for my AP Computer Science class. My goal was to read data from a CSV file and use the data from that file and return certain pieces of information from the file to a user when called. I decided to do my project over the 2012 election and return results based on county and state from user input. I chose this election in particular, because it was one of the first real elections I remember. I was in 4th grade and probably around 9-10 years old when this election happened and I remember lots of news coverage and conversation about this election even at my young age. 


### What library/libraries did I use for this project?
This was my first use of external libraries within java. With this project I used the sinbad software library that is used for Java, but also for other languages like Python and Racket. The project uses online data sources and offline data sources such as CSV, JSON, and XML files in order to read and parse data to be used for software.
