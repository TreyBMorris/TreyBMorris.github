<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Trey Morris, and I write code.</p>

<p> Since a young age, I've had a passion with computers and a desire to always want to learn more about computing. I am currently studying as a Computer Science Student at Kennesaw State University in Marietta, Georgia.</p>

<p> My first experience into the world of computer science was writing static HTML pages for school projects and for friends in my free time. Since then, I have expanded my skills and knowledge by diving into writing programs in Java, C#, and Python. Recently, I have learned more about database systems, data structures, and software engineering through my schooling. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of full-stack development, learning frameworks such as .NET with Blazor Server, Java Spring Boot, and front-end frameworks such as Angular and React. I am eager and willing to earn more experience in the field of Computer Science through teachings, self exploration, real world experience, and more.</p> 


<p> This website is to give a general overview of my computer Science and software engineering knowledge and serve as a basic portfolio of my projects. </p>
