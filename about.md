<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Trey Morris, and I write programs.</p>

<p> Since a young age I have had a passion with a deep interest in computers and a desire to always want to learn more about computing. I am currently a computer science student at Kennesaw State University in Marietta, Georgia, where I am working on an undergraduate degree in Computer Science.</p>

<p> My first experience into the world of Computer Science was writing static HTML pages for school projects and for friends in my free time. My skills in HTML are backed by the LinkedIn HTML Badge that you can find on my LinkedIn page. Since then, I have expanded my skills and knowledge by diving into writing programs in Java and Python. Recently I have expanded my knowledge by learning about Database Systems, operations, and management through my schooling. I am eager and willing to earn more experience in the field of Computer Science through teachings, self exploration, real world experience, and more.</p> 


<p> This website is to give a general overview of my Computer Science knowledge and serve basic portfolio of my projects. </p>
