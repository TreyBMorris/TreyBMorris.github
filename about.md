<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Trey Morris, and I write code.</p>

<p> Since a young age, I've had a passion with computers and a desire to always want to learn more about computing. I am currently studying as a Computer Science Student at Kennesaw State University in Marietta, Georgia.</p>

<p> My first experience into the world of Computer Science, was writing static HTML pages for school projects and for friends in my free time. Since then, I have expanded my skills and knowledge by diving into writing programs in Java and Python. Recently, I have expanded my knowledge by learning about Database Systems, Data Structures, and Software Engineering through my schooling. In my free time, I enjoy exploring the world of Full-Stack development, learning frameworks such as .NET with Blazor, Java Spring Boot, and front-end frameworks such as Angular. I am eager and willing to earn more experience in the field of Computer Science through teachings, self exploration, real world experience, and more.</p>
